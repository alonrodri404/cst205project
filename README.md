# Alondra Rodriguez: Hello, I worked on the backend functions of the code. I made sure that every button was working when pressed and made the filters/filter sliders. I worked with Daniel Solano, another backend programmer, and we helped each other with the animal random picture generator to display in main, including creating an upload button that is functional.
